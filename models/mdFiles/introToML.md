# Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.

### 1.1 Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Training on labeled data.
   - Example: Predicting house prices.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
   - Example: Customer segmentation.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning by interacting with an environment.
   - Example: Game-playing AI.

## 2. Key Concepts in Machine Learning
### 2.1 Training and Testing Data
- **Training Set**: Data used to train the model.
- **Test Set**: Data used to evaluate the model.

### 2.2 Features and Labels
- **Features**: Input variables (e.g., height, weight).
- **Label**: Output variable (e.g., category, price).

### 2.3 Overfitting vs. Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting**: Model fails to capture patterns in the data.

## 3. Popular Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values.
- **Decision Trees**: Split data based on conditions.
- **Neural Networks**: Mimic the human brain for complex problems.

## 4. Steps in a Machine Learning Project
1. **Define the Problem**
2. **Collect and Prepare Data**
3. **Choose a Model**
4. **Train the Model**
5. **Evaluate and Improve**
6. **Deploy the Model**

## 5. Tools and Libraries
- **Scikit-learn**: For basic ML models.
- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**: For deep learning.
- **Keras**: Simplified API for neural networks.
