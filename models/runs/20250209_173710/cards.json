        "back": "In data science, reliable and accurate insights are crucial for making informed decisions. One common issue that arises from using Poor-Quality Data is that it can lead to Unreliable Insights.\n\nFor example, if a dataset contains Missing Values, the analysis might yield misleading Results because certain calculations or predictions cannot be made without those gaps. Similarly, Inconsistent Formatting and Omitting Relevant Features can cause Analytical Bias by filtering out important Information that should influence the outcome.",
